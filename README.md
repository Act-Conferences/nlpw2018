# α-version of the conference website for The Perl Conference 2017 in Amsterdam

See https://github.com/Act-Conferences/tpc-2017-amsterdam/wiki/Pointers-for-updating-the-site for some help with updating this site.

## What's happening?

Currently in the process of adapting templates to bootstrap v4.x. The default wrapper actdocs/templates/ui shows pages in a bootstrap v3.x page, which functions but isn't quite consistent with the front page style.

Once templates are adapted to bootstrap v4.x, the wrapper can be replaced with actdocs/templates/ui_bootstrap4 in each template individually.

To keep track of the progress, a log of the templates that have been converted is maintained on:
