α-version of the conference website for The Perl Conference 2017 in Amsterdam

Unfortunately we stumbled upon an incompatibility between our frontpage based on the latest Bootstrap (v4.0.0-alpha.2) and a set of responsive ACT templates we intended to use (https://github.com/barcelonapm/act-responsive, kindly provided by the Barcelona Perl Mongers), which are based on Bootstrap  v3.2.0.

Therefore, for the moment the look-and-feel of the frontpage doesn't match the underlying pages, but at least all pages should be functional.

Updates will follow in due course.
