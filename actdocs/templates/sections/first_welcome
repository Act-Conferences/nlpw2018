          <h2>Welcome to The Perl Conference</h2>
          <p>
We invite you to participate in The Perl Conference, which will take
place in August 2017 in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.  These meetings were
formerly known as YAPC::EU, the yearly meeting of Perl Mongers in Europe.
          </p>
          <p>
The Perl conferences started off as grassroots user meetings, with
discussions among Perl Mongers, and has grown from there.  The focus is
on enjoying the ideas of others, discovering new concepts, and feeling the
enthusiasm of fellow programmers in the Perl (5) and Perl 6 programming
languages.
          </p>
          <p>
This years' theme is: <b>High-end Perl</b>. We are open for contributions:
sponsors and potential speakers, please continue reading this page.
