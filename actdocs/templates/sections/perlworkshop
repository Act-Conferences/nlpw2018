                The Perl workshop is a day of presentations for users of the
                programming language Perl of all levels. There will be some of
                the developers who continue to extend the language itself as
                well as the many modules written in it and there will be
                professional users of Perl from many organisations. But also
                newcomers are warmly welcomed.

                During the presentations and informal conversations, you will be
                kept up-to-date about the latest additions to the language
                itself and the available modules. And most likely, as you go
                along, you'll come across solutions to some of your day-to-day
                programming issues.
