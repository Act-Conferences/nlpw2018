          <h2>Sponsors make for a better conference</h2>
          <p>
We already have contracted a few large sponsors, but are still in need
of contributions of various sizes.  Companies, please show our community
that you appreciate its existence - that you also benefit from.

can help this Perl conference to be affordable for everyone.
