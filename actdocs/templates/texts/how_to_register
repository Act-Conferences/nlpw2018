  <h2>Registration and payment</h2>
  <p>
  You're currently not logged in, so we're showing information for users who may or may not have an account already.
  </p>
  <p>
  Please note that registration and payment are two separate steps. You first need to register as an attendee (see below) and then purchase your conference ticket (see <a href="[% make_uri('tickets.html') %]">Tickets and Payment</a> page).
  </p>
  
  <h2>Registering with or without a previous account</h2>
  
  <p>There is a slight difference depending on whether you already have an account from a previous Perl conference.</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>If you already have an account...
      <ul>
        <li>Just click [% INCLUDE texts/register_link reg_link_text='Register for this conference' %].
        </li>
        <li>Then log in as a <b>Returning user</b> and a button to join the conference will appear.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    
    <li>If you don't have an account yet...
      <ul>
        <li>You also click [% INCLUDE texts/register_link reg_link_text='Register for this conference' %].
        <li>Then you supply an email address under <b>"No account yet?"</b>.</li>
        <li>You'll receive a confirmation link by email. Open it and follow the instructions.</li>
        <li>This process will <i>create your account</i> and <i>register you for the conference</i> at the same time.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
