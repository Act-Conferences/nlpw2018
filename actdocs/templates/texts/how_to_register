  <h2>Registration and payment</h2>
  <p>
  You're currently not logged in, so we're showing information for users who may or may not have an account already.
  </p>
  <p>
  Please note that registration and payment are two separate steps. You first need to register as an attendee (see below) and then purchase your conference ticket (see <a href="[% make_uri('cost-and-payment.html') %]">Cost and Payment</a> page).
  </p>
  
  <h2>Registering with or without a previous account</h2>
  
  <p>There is a slight difference depending on whether you already have an account from a previous Perl conference.</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>If you don't have an account yet...
      <ul>
        <li>Submit your email address in the <b>"No account yet?"</b> section of the <a href="[% make_uri('main') %]">Login/Registration</a> page.
        </li>
        <li>Click the link in the email you'll receive and follow the instructions.</li>
        <li>This process will 1) create your account, 2) register you for the conference and 3) log you in all in one go.</li>
  
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>If you already have an account...
      <ul>
        <li>Log in using the <b>"Returning user"</b> section of the <a href="[% make_uri('main') %]">Login/Registration</a> page.
        </li>
        <li>Upon login, you'll be taken to your <b>User Settings</b> page with a link to <b>"register for this conference"</b>.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
